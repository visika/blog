and my [personal library](https://inventaire.io/inventory/visika);
I give away many books I read.

I volunteer at [Monachelle Community](https://www.monachelle.org),

I manage the full tech stack, from domain name registration to graphics design,
from copywriting to social media management.
I'm managing and promoting the fundraising campaing for the project,
comprising raising funds to defend volunteers in court,
and raising funds to regenerate the abandoned area.
