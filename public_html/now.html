		<p>This page was inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a> and is a snapshot
		of what I'm currently doing in my life.</p>
		
		<h1>University</h1>
		
		<p>
		  I'm studying for my master degree in physics at Federico II University of Naples.
		  Last year was shit because of the stay home order;
		  my house is in a noisy setting and it's hard to concentrate.
		  I hope we'll get back in person to the University.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  I'm currently studying quantum mechanics and complex systems courses.
		</p>

		<p>I spent August learning Clojure.
		Now reading Clojure from the ground up.
		I was attracted to it by Roam Research and Athens Research.</p>

		<p>Trying to keep it going forward and become a better man in this pandemic mess.
		I used to practice aikido but the dojo closed since the quarantine;
		during this time I exercise home with free-body exercises.
		Aikido was not just moving the body, it was settling the mind;
		to compensate for its absence, I’m meditating in the morning every few days.
		I'm using an app named Headspace to start the habit.</p>

		<p>I enjoyed this summer going to the sea, snorkeling, boat sailing or canoeing,
		helping friends renovate their house.</p>

		<p>I seem to have found the causes of my allergy: dust and sleep deprivation.
		I made the promise to go to bed early (before 23) and I can feel the change.
		I can breathe through my nose. I can break the rule every now and then by going to sleep late,
		but never more nights in a row, otherwise my body reacts badly to it.
		I found helpful to use ear plugs for loud noises and to care to change my bed sheets to reduce dust mites.</p>

		<p>I'm watching Attack on Titan on my home theater with my younger brother.</p>

		<p>Helping hand at Monachelle local community.</p>

		<p>[FAILED] I'm setting up my Matrix home-server with bridges with a friend,
		so we can use just one app to message friends on different platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>

		<p>Reading about personal knowledge management.
		I enjoyed How to take smart notes, by Sönke Ahrens.</p>

		<p>
		  I've been using Linux for many years now.
		  Although I'm not an expert, I might know some tricks to solve your problem.
		  Also, if anyone would like to switch from another operating system,
		  I know a handful of alternatives to proprietary apps. Ask away!
		</p>

		<p>Bought a 3D printer, still figuring out how to fully make use of it.</p>

		<p>
		  Tried Dvorak because it was the <em>right thing</em>.
		  Switched back.
		  I need a machine configured to use Dvorak at the BIOS level;
		  otherwise typing a password at boot becomes a nightmare.
		</p>

		<p>Finished playing Red Dead Redemption II; exploring and having fun online.</p>

		<p>
		  I'm revisiting double-entry bookkeeping, switching from ledger-cli
		  to beancount, as I find it more appealing regarding capital gains calculation.
